            <p>Kuélap, or Cuélap, is an important pre-Inca archaeological site located in the northeastern Andes of Peru, in the Province of Luya. It was built by the Chachapoyas culture.

            It forms a large stone architectural complex characterized by its monumental condition, with a large artificial platform, oriented from south to north, set on the calcareous rock ridge at the top of Cerro Barreta (at 3000 m.a.s.l.). The platform extends for almost 600 meters and is surrounded by a wall that is 19 meters high at some points.
                
            It is estimated that its construction must have begun around the 11th century, coinciding with the flourishing period of the Chachapoyas culture, and its occupation must have ended around the middle of the 16th century. Its colossal walls and its complex interior architecture are evidence of its function as a well-organized population complex, which includes administrative and religious enclosures, ceremonial spaces, and permanent residence.</p>

It is considered one of the most important of humanity.1 The original name of the country, especially during the Old Kingdom, was Kemet (Km.t), 'black land', due to the color of the fertilizing silt that covered it during the regular annual flooding the valley that lies on the banks of the Nile River, as opposed to Deshret (dsr.t, 'red earth'), by the sand of the Sahara desert, which covers most of the Egyptian territory.</p>
